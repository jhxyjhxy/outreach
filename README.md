# ACM Outreach Mockups

## Basic HTML Website: [here!](https://jhxyjhxy.github.io/outreach/)
### Notes
For younger students: 
- Take out CSS but could leave some styling in `<script>` tags
- Take out `<div>` tags
- Add links since those are pretty simple

For older / more advanced students: 
- Can probably use multiple files like a `style.css` and/or `script.js` 
- Introduce `<div>`
- Talk about box model (borders, padding, etc.)
- Probably take out flexbox
- Add links or buttons
  - If buttons: maybe add an event listener for a popup window
